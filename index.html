                The Elephant's Foot is the nickname given to a large mass of Corium
                and other materials formed underneath the Chernobyl Nuclear Power
                Plant, near Pripyat, Ukraine, during the Chernobyl disaster of April
                1986. Discovered in December that year, it is presently located in a
                maintenance corridor underneath the remains of Reactor No. 4. It
                remains an extremely radioactive object [...] The molten mass of reactor core dripped under the reactor
                vessel and now is solidified in forms of stalactites, stalagmites, and lava flows.

                By the fall of 1986, the emergency crews fighting to contain the nuclear disaster at
                Chernobyl made it into a steam corridor beneath failed reactor Number 4. Inside this
                chamber they found black lava that had oozed straight from the core. The most famous
                formation was a solid flow that their radiation sensors firmly told them not to approach.
                With cameras pushed in from around a corner, the workers dubbed the dimly lit mass “the Elephant’s
                Foot.”
                According to readings taken at the time, the still hot portion of molten core put out enough radiation
                to give a lethal dose in 300 seconds.<br>
                The Elephant’s Foot could be the most dangerous piece of waste in the world.

                <center>What Is the Chernobyl Elephant's Foot?</center><br>
                Because Elephant's Foot was so radioactive, scientists at the time used a camera on a wheel to
                photograph
                it. A few researchers got close enough to take samples for analysis. What they found was that Elephant's
                Foot was not the remnants of the nuclear fuel. Instead, nuclear experts explain that the Elephant's Foot
                is
                composed of a rare substance called Corium, which is produced in a nuclear accident when nuclear fuel
                and
                parts of the
                reactor core structures overheat and melt, forming a mixture.<br>
