                The Elephant's Foot is the nickname given to a large mass of Corium
                and other materials formed underneath the Chernobyl Nuclear Power
                Plant, near Pripyat, Ukraine, during the Chernobyl disaster of April
                1986. Discovered in December that year, it is presently located in a
                maintenance corridor underneath the remains of Reactor No. 4. It
                remains an extremely radioactive object [...]

                by Kyle Hill]</h4>
            <p>By the fall of 1986, the emergency crews fighting to contain the nuclear disaster at
                Chernobyl made it into a steam corridor beneath failed reactor Number 4. Inside this
                chamber they found black lava that had oozed straight from the core. The most famous
                formation was a solid flow that their radiation sensors firmly told them not to approach.
                With cameras pushed in from around a corner, the workers dubbed the dimly lit mass “the Elephant’s
                Foot.”
                According to readings taken at the time, the still hot portion of molten core put out enough radiation
                to give a lethal dose in 300 seconds.</p>
            <br>
            The Elephant’s Foot could be the most dangerous piece of waste in the world.</p>

                Toxic Mass of Corium</a> by Patrick J. Kiger:]
            </h3>

            <b>What Is the Chernobyl Elephant's Foot?</b>
            <p>Because Elephant's Foot was so radioactive, scientists at the time used a camera on a wheel to photograph
                it.
                A few researchers got close enough to take samples for analysis. What they found was that Elephant's
                Foot was
                not the remnants of the nuclear fuel.Instead, nuclear experts explain that the Elephant's Foot is
                composed of a
                rare substance called corium, which is produced in a nuclear accident when nuclear fuel and parts of the
                reactor
                core structures overheat and melt, forming a mixture.</p>

            <div class="facts">
                <h2>Corium has only formed naturally five times in history:</h2>
                <ol>

                    <li>Chernobyl Disaster in 1986</li>

                </ol>
            </div>

            <p>Mitchell T. Farmer, a veteran nuclear engineer and program manager at the Argonne National Laboratory
                says via email that Corium
                looks "a lot like lava, a blackish-oxide material that gets very viscous as it cools down, flowing like
                sticky molten glass. That
                is what happened at Chernobyl with the Elephant's Foot."</p>
